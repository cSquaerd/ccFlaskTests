# Flask Tests
## By Charlie Cook, begun Feb. 22nd, 2021

This project contains a Flask application written in Python that tests various
features of Flask, as well as the Brython module that takes on the job of
Javascript.

To run, navigate to the root directory of this project and run `python
flaskHello.py`, then open a web browser to `localhost:5000`. You can then visit
several pages, each outlined in the `add_url_rule` calls in the aforementioned
.py file.
